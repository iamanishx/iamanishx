# Hey there! 👋

- My main focus is on [TS/JS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/) but I also enjoy working with [C++](https://isocpp.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) in my spare time. As a programming language enthusiast, I’m always exploring new languages and technologies.
- Right now, I’m diving deep into core Computer Science concepts to strengthen my fundamentals.
- Beyond languages, I'm expanding my knowledge in algorithms, databases and cloud systems.
- 📫 **Connect with me:** I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-biswal-xd) and Twitter, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or have any questions!
