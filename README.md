# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

- My main focus is on [TS/JS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/) but I also enjoy working with [C++](https://isocpp.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) in my spare time. As a programming language enthusiast, Iâ€™m always exploring new languages and technologies.
- Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into core Computer Science concepts to strengthen my fundamentals.
- Beyond languages, I'm expanding my knowledge in algorithms, databases and cloud systems.
- ðŸ“« **Connect with me:** Iâ€™m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-biswal-xd) and Twitter, so feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to connect or have any questions!
